simple project, but still interesting.
a program that stores your accounts, with a terminal interface. as soon as the app is launched, it loads the accounts that are saved on disk and enters a main menu
through which the user can add, edit and delete all the accounts saved.

"simple project" since it does not guarantee security, as the passwords/emails are stored in a text file. privacy was not the central point of this project (might become in future, tho); diving deeper in python programming was.
